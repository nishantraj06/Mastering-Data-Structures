# Mastering-Data-Structures
Tracking my journey through the 180+ DSA Sheet. Solutions focused on optimal Time &amp; Space complexity ($O(N)$), clean code practices, and the Two-Pointer/Sliding Window patterns. 🚀
# 🎯 Roadmap to SDE: Data Structures & Algorithms

> "Consistency is the bridge between goals and accomplishment." 

This repository is a dedicated log of my journey to master Problem Solving. I am following a structured DSA sheet to transition from an "Average Student" to a "Problem Solver."

---

## 🚀 The Mission
- **Duration:** 100+ Days of Consistency.
- **Primary Language:** JavaScript (MERN Stack focus).
- **Goal:** Solve 180+ curated problems and understand the "Why" behind every algorithm.


| # | Problem | Difficulty | Logic | Performance | Status |
|---|---------|------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Two Sum II | Medium | Inward pointers on sorted array | 96.00% 🚀 | ✅ |
| 2 | Sorted Squares | Easy | Two-pointer merge-style pass | $O(N)$ Time | ✅ |
| 3 | Valid Palindrome | Easy | Skipping non-alphanumeric chars | $O(N)$ Time | ✅ |
| 4 | Move Zeroes | Easy | Snowball/Zero-pointer swap | $O(1)$ Space | ✅ |
| 5 | Remove Duplicates | Easy | Slow/Fast pointer overwrite | $O(1)$ Space | ✅ |
| 6 | Sort Colors | Medium | Dutch National Flag (One-pass) | 100.00% 👑 | ✅ |
 7 | seperation 0 & 1 | Two-pointeer | moves all ones at end .| ✅ |
