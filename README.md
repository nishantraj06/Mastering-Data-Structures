# Mastering-Data-Structures
Tracking my journey through the 180+ DSA Sheet. Solutions focused on optimal Time &amp; Space complexity ($O(N)$), clean code practices, and the Two-Pointer/Sliding Window patterns. 🚀
# 🎯 Roadmap to SDE: Data Structures & Algorithms

> "Consistency is the bridge between goals and accomplishment." 

This repository is a dedicated log of my journey to master Problem Solving. I am following a structured DSA sheet to transition from an "Average Student" to a "Problem Solver."

---

## 🚀 The Mission
- **Duration:** 100+ Days of Consistency.
- **Primary Language:** JavaScript (MERN Stack focus).
- **Goal:** Solve 180+ curated problems and understand the "Why" behind every algorithm.

| # | Problem | Topic | Logic | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 01 | Two Sum II | Two-Pointer | Binary Search-like movement on sorted array. | ✅ |
| 02 | Sorted Squares | Two-Pointer | Comparing squares from both ends. | ✅ |
| 03 | seperation 0 & 1 | Two-pointeer | moves all ones at end .| ✅ | 
| 03 | Valid Palindrome | Two-Pointer | Skipping non-alphanumeric & inward comparison. | ✅ |
| 04 | Move Zeroes | Array Logic | Using a `zero_pointer` to swap non-zero elements. | ✅ |
