# Mastering-Data-Structures

Tracking my journey through the 180+ DSA Sheet. Solutions focused on optimal Time &amp; Space complexity ($O(N)$), clean code practices, and the Two-Pointer/Sliding Window patterns. 🚀
# 🎯 Roadmap to SDE: Data Structures & Algorithms

> "Consistency is the bridge between goals and accomplishment." 

This repository is a dedicated log of my journey to master Problem Solving. I am following a structured DSA sheet to transition from an "Average Student" to a "Problem Solver."

---

## 🚀 The Mission
- **Duration:** 100+ Days of Consistency.
- **Primary Language:** JavaScript (MERN Stack focus).
- **Goal:** Solve 180+ curated problems and understand the "Why" behind every algorithm.
