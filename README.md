# Mastering-Data-Structures
Tracking my journey through the 180+ DSA Sheet. Solutions focused on optimal Time &amp; Space complexity ($O(N)$), clean code practices, and the Two-Pointer/Sliding Window patterns. 🚀
# 🎯 Roadmap to SDE: Data Structures & Algorithms

> "Consistency is the bridge between goals and accomplishment." 

This repository is a dedicated log of my journey to master Problem Solving. I am following a structured DSA sheet to transition from an "Average Student" to a "Problem Solver."

---

## 🚀 The Mission
- **Duration:** 100+ Days of Consistency.
- **Primary Language:** JavaScript (MERN Stack focus).
- **Goal:** Solve 180+ curated problems and understand the "Why" behind every algorithm.

## 🛠️ My Learning Framework
For every problem I solve, I follow these steps:
1. **Understand:** Read the problem twice.
2. **Brute Force:** Solve it the "naive" way first.
3. **Optimize:** Find a better approach using patterns like *Two-Pointers* or *HashMaps*.
4. **Analyze:** Calculate Time Complexity $O(N)$ and Space Complexity $O(1)$.
5. **Document:** Commit the code with clear variable names.
